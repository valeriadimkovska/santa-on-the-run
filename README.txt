 Merry Christmas Everyone! '18

An infinite Santa runner. 

This is my first game using phaser.js and I'm still learning.. You may find a few bugs ;)

Jumping sound made with http://www.bfxr.net/
Xmas music from [this midi file](http://www.free-midi.org/song/christmas_songs-driving_home_for_christmas.html) Converted to mp3, and cut it to a decent loop for the game.
Ho ho ho sound from [soundfxnow](http://soundfxnow.com) Santa, BG, and platform images from [spriters resource] (http://www.spriters-resource.com/)
